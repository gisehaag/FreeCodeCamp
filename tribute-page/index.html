				<p class="bold">Here's a time line of Marie Curie's life:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<span class="bold">November 7, 1867</span> | Maria Salomea Skłodowska, later known as Marie Curie, is
						born in Warsaw, in what is at the time the Congress Kingdom of Poland, Russian Empire.
					</li>
					<li>
						<span class="bold">1883–85</span> | Skłodowska wins a gold medal as top student in her class upon
						completion of her secondary education. Because her father has lost his savings through bad investment
						she has to go to work, finding employment first as a teacher and later as a governess. From her
						earnings she is able to finance her sister Bronislawa’s medical studies in Paris, France, with the
						understanding that Bronislawa will in turn later help her to get an education.
					</li>
					<li>
						<span class="bold">1891–94</span> | Skłodowska moves to Paris in 1891 to study at the Sorbonne. She
						begins to use the name Marie. She studies far into the night and completes degrees in physics and
						math. In the spring of 1894 she meets Pierre Curie, who is completing his doctorate of science.
					</li>
					<li>
						<span class="bold">1895</span> | Marie and Pierre marry on July 25. She takes her husband’s surname.
						Their marriage marks the beginning of a partnership that is soon to achieve results of world
						significance.
					</li>
					<li>
						<span class="bold">1896–98</span> | In 1896 a French scientist named Henri Becquerel finds that the
						element uranium gives off unusual rays of energy. He passes his findings on to Marie, who begins
						studying the phenomenon, which she later names radioactivity. In 1898 the Curies announce their
						discovery of two new elements, radium and polonium. They name polonium after Marie’s homeland of
						Poland.
					</li>
					<li>
						<span class="bold">1903</span> | Marie earns her doctorate of science in June, becoming the first
						woman in France to receive a doctoral degree. In November Marie and Pierre share with Becquerel the
						Nobel Prize for Physics for the discovery and research of radioactivity. Marie is the first woman to
						receive the honor. (In submitting its nomination to the Nobel committee, the French Academy of
						Sciences had not acknowledged Marie’s contributions and omitted her name, but it was later put forward
						after Pierre insisted that they be considered for the prize together.)
					</li>
					<li>
						<span class="bold">1906</span> | Pierre dies in a traffic accident on April 19. Marie takes over his
						professorship at the Sorbonne in May. She is the first woman to teach there. She devotes all of her
						energy to completing alone the scientific work that she and Pierre had undertaken.
					</li>
					<li><span class="bold">1910</span> | Marie’s fundamental treatise on radioactivity is published.</li>
					<li>
						<span class="bold">1911</span> | Marie is awarded the Nobel Prize for Chemistry, for the isolation of
						pure radium.
					</li>
					<li>
						<span class="bold">1914–18</span> | World War I begins in 1914. Throughout the war Marie, with the
						help of her daughter Irène devotes herself to making X-ray technology available for use in the medical
						treatment of wounded soldiers.
					</li>
					<li>
						<span class="bold">1922</span> | From this date Marie focuses her research on the chemistry of
						radioactive substances and the medical applications of these substances.
					</li>
					<li>
						<span class="bold">1932</span> | Marie helps open the Radium Institute in Warsaw. Her sister,
						Bronislawa, is named director of the institute.
					</li>
					<li>
						<span class="bold">July 4, 1934</span> | Marie dies near Sallanches, France. Her death is the result
						of leukemia caused by exposure to radiation.
					</li>
					<li>
						<span class="bold">1944</span> | American chemists discover a new element. They name it curium in
						honor of Marie and Pierre Curie.
					</li>
